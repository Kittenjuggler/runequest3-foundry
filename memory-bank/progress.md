## Current Status

### Implementation Completeness
- **Core Mechanics**: 85% complete - All major RQ3 systems implemented
- **User Interface**: 80% complete - Functional but could use polish
- **Data Management**: 90% complete - Comprehensive data structures
- **System Integration**: 95% complete - Well-integrated with Foundry VTT

### Code Quality
- **Architecture**: Excellent - Clean modular design with ES6 patterns
- **File Size Compliance**: Needs review - Files should be < 500 lines
- **Component Size**: Needs review - Functions should be < 50 lines when possible
- **Documentation**: Good - Well-commented code with clear structure
- **Maintainability**: High - Small, focused function files
- **CSS Organization**: Needs improvement - CSS should be in smaller, targeted files
- **Performance**: Good - Efficient data handling and UI updates

### Known Issues
- **Minor UI Glitches**: Some visual elements may need adjustment
- **Performance**: Large campaigns may experience some slowdown (mitigated with lazy loading)
- **Error Handling**: ✅ Comprehensive error handling implemented for critical functions
- **Testing**: Limited testing coverage across all features
