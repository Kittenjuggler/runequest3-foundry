- ✅ GitHub repository setup completed
- ✅ Characteristic roll tooltip implementation completed
- ✅ Tooltip positioning and event handling fixes implemented
- ✅ CSS cleanup and inline style removal completed
- ✅ **Compact header completely removed and all header change functionality eliminated**
- ✅ **JavaScript tab change handlers removed**
- ✅ **CSS rules for header switching removed**
- ✅ **Derived stats moved from header to main tab for better organization**
- ✅ **Luck characteristic added to the system (str, con, siz, int, pow, dex, app, luck)**
- ✅ **Characteristics table reorganized into 2 columns of 4 for better layout**
- ✅ **Luck abbreviation updated from "LUC" to "LUCK" for clarity**
- ✅ **Header layout reorganized: status bars moved to full-width horizontal layout below main header**
- ✅ **Character name field height reduced by 20% and positioned alongside edit toggle**
- ✅ **Characteristics section sizing reduced to fit better with new layout**
- ✅ **Image, name, and attributes now grouped in single main header block**

- ✅ **Edit toggle styling updated: border removed, text changed to 'Edit', padding reduced**
- ✅ **Status bar labels moved inside bars and aligned left**
- ✅ **Status bar values aligned right and vertically centered within bars**
- ✅ **Status bar fill colors restored (danger/warning states for HP, fatigue, encumbrance)**
- ✅ **Encumbrance details converted from slidedown to hover tooltip functionality**
- ✅ **Training ticks for skills and POW now manually controlled by user clicks instead of auto-ticking**
- ✅ **Training tick functionality now available in both edit and non-edit modes**

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### CSS Architecture Principles
**CRITICAL**: Avoid inline CSS with `!important` declarations unless absolutely unavoidable. Use proper CSS classes and external stylesheets instead.

**Completed Improvements:**
- ✅ Tooltip positioning uses CSS custom properties instead of inline styles
- ✅ All `!important` declarations removed from roll tooltip styles
- ✅ Proper CSS classes implemented for tooltip positioning
- ✅ Consistent styling with existing damage tooltip system

### Tooltip System Status
- ✅ Tooltip creation and positioning working consistently
- ✅ Event handling fixed (delayed click-outside handler)
- ✅ CSS implementation cleaned up and optimized
- ✅ **Works consistently across all tabs with simplified header system**

### Header Layout Decision
- ✅ **Compact header completely removed** to eliminate positioning inconsistencies
- ✅ **All header change functionality removed** (JavaScript handlers, CSS rules, tab-based switching)
- ✅ **Single full header now always visible** on all tabs for consistent user experience
- ✅ **Tooltip positioning now works reliably** regardless of tab context
- ✅ **Simplified layout reduces complexity** and maintenance overhead
- ✅ **No more tab-based header switching logic** in JavaScript or CSS

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Test tooltip functionality across all tabs with simplified header
2. **Short-term**: Verify consistent behavior in different tab contexts
3. **Medium-term**: Apply same CSS principles to other components if needed
4. **Long-term**: Maintain consistent header layout across all system components

## Technical Notes
- **Header change functionality completely removed** from JavaScript (`_onFoundryTabChange` method eliminated)
- **CSS rules for header switching removed** (`.non-main-tab`, `.compact-header` styles eliminated)
- **Foundry VTT positioning challenges resolved** by using consistent header layout
- Tooltips now use CSS custom properties for dynamic positioning
- Mouse tracking implemented as fallback positioning method
- All event handlers properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks
- **System now uses single header approach** eliminating all tab-based header logic
